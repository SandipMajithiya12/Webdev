We see this website as a form of digital art as all images and text were generated by artificial intelligence (with a little bit of human help). Basically, this AI blog is written and designed by impressive AIs, and humans merely perform copy & paste operations - we showcase the progress of AI capabilities on all fronts (text, image, design, technology, education, etc).",
